Automatic facial recognition has a wide range of applications, such as human-computer interaction and security systems. Being able to understand oneâ€™s emotions and the encoded feelings is an important factor for an appropriate and correct understanding. With the ongoing research in the field of robotics, especially in the field of humanoid robots, it becomes interesting to integrate these capabilities into machines allowing for a more diverse and natural way of communication. Our models are still far to perfect, but this area of AI will be surely developed in the future.
