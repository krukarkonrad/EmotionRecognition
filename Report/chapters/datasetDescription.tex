Data that we got is in one *.csv file with two columns:
\begin{itemize}
  \item number of emotion \\
    in rage 0 - 6:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 0 - angry
        \item 1 - disgust
        \item 2 - fear
        \item 3 - happy
        \item 4 - sad
        \item 5 - surprise
        \item 6 - neutral
    \end{itemize}
  \item string of pixels \\
    Pixels are in one long string (2304 of them), they are in gray scale 0 - 255.\\
    We need to preprocess them into array of 48x48x1 that will could be reorganised as
    a picture also we will change to rage to 0 - 1 scale - by dividing via 255
    \lstinputlisting[language=Python, firstline=17, lastline=39]{../Model/Approach1.py}
    After that we need to multiplay the layers into (48, 48, 3) becouse VGG16 CNN is prepared for RGB pictures.
    So basically recopy gray pixels 2 times more.
    \lstinputlisting[language=Python, firstline=42, lastline=45]{../Model/Approach1.py}


\end{itemize}
