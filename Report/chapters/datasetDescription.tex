Data that we got is in one *.csv file with two columns:
\begin{itemize}
  \item number of emotion \\
    in rage 0 - 6:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 0 - angry
        \item 1 - disgust
        \item 2 - fear
        \item 3 - happy
        \item 4 - sad
        \item 5 - surprise
        \item 6 - neutral
    \end{itemize}
  \item string of pixels \\
    Pixels are in one long string (2304 of them), they are in gray scale 0 - 255.\\
    We need to preprocess them into array of 48x48x1 that will could be reorganised as an picture also we will change to rage to 0 - 1 scale - by dividing via 255
